# Expectation Maximization for Gaussian Mixtures

The following figure demonstrates Expectation Maximization (EM) for Gaussian Mixtures on the *Old Faithful* dataset. (*Old Faithful* is a famous geyser in Yellowstone National Park, US.)

Plotting the waiting time between eruptions over eruption time reveals a "cluster" structure. In this project I model this structure with a Gaussian Mixture Model. Equations and algorithms can be found in `EM_gaussian_mixture.ipynb`.
